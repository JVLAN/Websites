## RickRoll
Our internal RickRoller website. 
Often hosted on rickroll.jvlan.ch.
It's a simple redirection to a Mp4 file.
Combined with our Firewall, this redirects players that start to look at "suspisoucs" things on the web to a rickroll.
We play the Mp4 file directly so that the sound plays out loud, and the girl/guy is shamed. 
To avoir pepole playing around, in our firewall we create an internal natting rule to redirect DNS traffic to one of our DNS, which will always redirect to a rickroll if the user tries to go on a Illegal/Prohibited website.
